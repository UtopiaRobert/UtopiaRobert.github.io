    <h2>My Story</h2>
    <p>I’m Robert Redecker, a healer, teacher, and nature-based guide. My journey has taken me across continents, from growing up in Europe to walking the Camino de Santiago, to living in desert communities where I’ve worked to reconnect with the Earth and help others do the same.</p>
    <p>My background in special education and my path through plant medicines, permaculture, and sacred ritual have shaped a healing practice that is grounded in compassion, humility, and listening.</p>

    <h2>My Lineage & Training</h2>
    <p>I have been initiated in the Amazonian healing traditions under the guidance of a Shipibo maestro and carry the blessings of the RAO KANO XOBO lineage. I’m a certified Kambo practitioner and have worked with a wide range of plant medicines and ancestral healing modalities.</p>
    <p>I am also trained in nonviolent communication, trauma-informed care, and hold a California teaching credential in Special Education.</p>

    <h2>My Healing Philosophy</h2>
    <p>I believe that true healing begins with reconnection — to the land, to the body, and to the deeper rhythms of spirit. My work is about holding space for that reconnection to occur with integrity and love.</p>
    <p>Whether through the sting of a bee, the purge of Kambo, the shock of cold water, or the silence of the desert, I help people return to their essence.</p>
