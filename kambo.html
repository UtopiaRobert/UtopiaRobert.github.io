      <h2>The Story of Kambo</h2>
      <p>Kambo medicine — also known as Sapo — is a powerful secretion from the Phyllomedusa bicolor frog of the Amazon. Indigenous tribes call it the “vaccine of the forest,” and have used it for centuries to purify the body, awaken intuition, and increase vitality.</p>
      <p>The practice spread globally after investigative journalist Peter Gorman introduced it to the outside world in the 1980s.</p>

  <h2>About My Practice</h2>
  <p>All Kambo treatments are administered by myself, <strong>Robert Redecker</strong>. I’ve been involved with Kambo for over 10 years and have received and facilitated countless sessions. My personal connection to this medicine is profound, and I continue to sit with it regularly.</p>

  <p>I received my first Kambo experience through the Santo Daime Church, where I also work extensively with Ayahuasca. These two medicines complement one another beautifully and are often used together to bring about deep healing and transformation.</p>

  <p>My background includes personal training and special education teaching. I trained informally through a California-based shamanic practitioner and was later certified by the <a href="https://iakp.org/" target="_blank">International Association of Kambo Practitioners (IAKP)</a>. I have also studied with the Shipibo in the Peruvian Amazon, where I recently spent another month with my spiritual family.</p>

  <p>It would be an honor to share this sacred medicine with you. Please <a href="contact.html">email me</a> to book a session.</p>

    <li><strong>$166</strong> per session</li>
    <li><strong>$122</strong> for returning friends</li>
