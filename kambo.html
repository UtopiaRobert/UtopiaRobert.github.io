    <h2>What is Kambo?</h2>
    <p>Kambo is a sacred frog medicine used by indigenous tribes of the Amazon basin for physical purification, energetic clearing, and spiritual alignment. It is derived from the secretion of the Phyllomedusa bicolor (giant monkey tree frog) and has been used for centuries to sharpen senses, cleanse the body, and increase resilience before hunting or ceremony.</p>

  <section id="process">
    <h2>The Kambo Process</h2>
    <p>During a session, small burns are made on the skin to allow the medicine to enter the lymphatic system. The experience usually includes intense purging (vomiting, sweating, and sometimes shaking or crying) as toxins are released physically and emotionally.</p>
    <p>People often report feelings of deep clarity, renewed strength, emotional release, and spiritual connection following the ceremony.</p>

  <section id="safety">
    <h2>Safety & Preparation</h2>
    <p>Kambo is a powerful medicine and must be treated with respect. It is not suitable for everyone. I conduct thorough intake interviews to assess readiness and safety. You should not take Kambo if you have heart problems, are pregnant, or are on certain medications.</p>
    <p>Hydration, fasting, and intention-setting are all part of preparation. I will guide you every step of the way.</p>
