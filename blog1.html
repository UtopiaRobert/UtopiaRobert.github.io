    <h2>August 2025</h2>
    <p>Gameleira da Terra is a 150-acre off-grid sanctuary nestled in the high desert landscape of Congress, Arizona. This land has become a canvas for restoration, sacred retreat, and long-term regenerative living. Inspired by the practices of permaculture, community stewardship, and spiritual ecology, our intention is to co-create a place where life and land support one another.</p>

```
<h3>Land and Vision</h3>
<p>The land is dotted with mesquite, ironwood, and desert wildflowers. It is raw and exposed, yet offers immense beauty, potential, and silence. Gameleira da Terra is envisioned as a refuge for transformation — a place to unplug, go inward, and reconnect with Earth through simplicity and sacred practice.</p>

<h3>Permaculture and Design</h3>
<p>Our design work follows permaculture ethics: Earth care, people care, and fair share. We are mapping contours, water flows, wind patterns, and seasonal cycles to inform where gardens, dwellings, and gathering spaces will arise. The goal is to restore life to degraded soil, invite pollinators and native plants back, and build resilience into the system from the start.</p>

<h3>Water and Energy</h3>
<p>We are working with limited water — a deep well and rain harvesting will become the lifeblood of the system. All structures are solar powered. A shaded common area, composting systems, and minimalistic dwellings are in the planning stages, designed to blend into the land rather than dominate it.</p>

<h3>Spiritual and Communal Roots</h3>
<p>Gameleira da Terra is more than a homestead — it is a vision for an intentional community rooted in healing, ceremony, and shared purpose. Elements of Santo Daime, silent retreats, sacred music, and earth-based ritual are guiding influences. The land itself is a teacher.</p>

<h3>What Comes Next</h3>
<p>We invite aligned individuals to visit, collaborate, or simply witness the unfolding of a dream. Updates will be posted here as the project grows — from building domes and gardens to hosting retreats and gatherings.</p>

<p>With gratitude,</p>
