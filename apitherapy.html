    <h2>What Is Apitherapy?</h2>
    <p>Apitherapy is the therapeutic use of bee products — including honey, pollen, propolis, royal jelly, and venom — to support healing, immune function, and emotional wellbeing. Among these, <strong>Bee Venom Therapy (BVT)</strong> is a traditional healing practice used to stimulate the body’s natural healing processes.</p>

    <h2>Why Bee Venom?</h2>
    <p>Bee venom contains powerful peptides like melittin and adolapin, known for their anti-inflammatory, immune-stimulating, and pain-relieving effects. BVT can be applied through live stings or microdoses using venom extracted and diluted in saline. It’s used by trained practitioners to address chronic illness, fatigue, inflammation, and certain autoimmune conditions.</p>

    <h2>Safety & Respect</h2>
    <p>This therapy must be done with great care and respect. <strong>Allergy testing and screening</strong> are required before starting. Not everyone is a candidate. I will guide you through preparation, treatment, and aftercare.</p>
    <p>Live bee sessions are only performed with full consent and informed awareness. As with all sacred medicines, this work is voluntary, guided, and grounded in ethics.</p>
