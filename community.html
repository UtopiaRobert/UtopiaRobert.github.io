    <h2>Vision</h2>
    <p>Our community is envisioned as a living sanctuary—where healing, sacred ritual, ecology, and mutual support come together to form a new way of being. It’s a place to slow down, live close to the land, and remember what it means to be in right relationship with each other and the Earth.</p>

    <h2>Core Values</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Spiritual growth grounded in lived practice</li>
      <li>Service and reciprocity with the Earth</li>
      <li>Shared meals, shared work, shared healing</li>
      <li>Simplicity, silence, ceremony, song</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

    <h2>Location & Land</h2>
    <p>The land is located in the high desert of Arizona, surrounded by wilderness, silence, and stars. It includes 330 acres of hills, washes, mesas, and sacred spaces under the care of a non-profit sanctuary foundation. Here we practice permaculture, land regeneration, and low-impact building.</p>
