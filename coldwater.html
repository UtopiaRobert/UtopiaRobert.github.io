    <h2>What Is Cold Water Therapy?</h2>
    <p>Cold Water Therapy is the practice of immersing the body in cold or icy water to activate the body’s natural healing systems. This ancient and globally practiced method is known to improve circulation, reduce inflammation, regulate mood, and increase mental resilience.</p>

    <h2>Why Cold Water?</h2>
    <p>Exposure to cold triggers a cascade of benefits: it stimulates the vagus nerve, helps regulate the nervous system, boosts immunity, and builds mental strength. For many, it is both a physical reset and a spiritual practice of surrender and presence.</p>
